BUSINESS\\n\\n\\nGENERAL\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\" or\\n\"Sunbeam\") is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer\\nproducts. The Company\\'s primary business is the manufacture, marketing and\\ndistribution of durable household consumer products through mass market and\\nother distributors in the United States and internationally. The Company also\\nsells its products to commercial end users such as hotels and other\\ninstitutions (the \"Away From Home\" category of the business).\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s product categories are: (1) Appliances (mixers, blenders,\\nfood steamers, bread makers, rice cookers, coffee makers, toasters, irons and\\ngarment steamers) (2) Health at Home (vaporizers, humidifiers, air cleaners,\\nwater filters, massagers, hot and cold packs, blood pressure monitors and\\nscales) (3) Personal Care and Comfort (shower massagers, hair clippers and\\ntrimmers, electric warming blankets and throws) (4) Outdoor Cooking (electric,\\ngas and charcoal grills and grill accessories) and (5) Away From Home (clippers\\nand related products for the professional beauty, barber and veterinarian trade\\nand sales of products to commercial and institutional channels). The\\nInternational Group is responsible for sales (primarily of small appliances,\\npersonal care, grills and comfort products, professional clippers and related\\nproducts) in all countries other than the United States.\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam products enjoy a long-standing reputation for quality, and a\\nmajority of the Company\\'s sales are from products which hold the number one or\\ntwo market share in their respective product categories.\\n\\n\\n     The Company was organized in 1989 (as Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc.) and in\\nSeptember 1990, Sunbeam acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities,\\nthrough a reorganization, of Allegheny International, Inc. (the \"Predecessor\"),\\nan entity operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the United\\nStates Bankruptcy Code since 1988. In August 1992, the Company completed a\\npublic offering of 20,000,000 shares of its common stock. In May 1995, the\\nCompany changed its name from Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. to Sunbeam\\nCorporation.\\n\\n\\nRESTRUCTURING AND GROWTH PLAN\\n\\n\\n     In the Fall of 1996, under newly elected Chairman, Albert J. Dunlap, the\\nCompany announced a major restructuring and growth plan. The restructuring\\nportion of the plan was completed during 1997, resulting in a significant\\nreduction in employees, facilities and costs, all of which is anticipated to\\ngenerate approximately $225 million in annual savings for the Company. As a\\npart of the restructuring plan, the Company divested its non-core businesses\\nand assets, including furniture, time and temperature, decorative bedding, gas\\nheaters and logs, Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered\\ntrademark/ scale businesses and the Company\\'s Biddeford, Maine textile mill.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s restructuring plan included the closure of 18 factories, 43\\nwarehouses and 5 headquarters, resulting in the consolidation of all corporate\\noffices into a single headquarters office located in Delray Beach, Florida and\\nan operations center at its Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution\\nfacility. The number of manufacturing facilities has been reduced from\\ntwenty-six to eight (four in the US and four international). See \"Properties\"\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\n     The Company has also consolidated all purchasing functions, substantially\\nreduced the number of stock keeping units maintained by the Company and\\noutsourced certain administrative, manufacturing and distribution activities.\\n\\n\\n     The Company has developed a comprehensive three year growth plan for its\\ncore businesses. Sunbeam\\'s goal is for revenues to double, reaching $2 billion\\nby 1999, with operating margins improving\\n\\n\\n                                       1\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nto 20% of sales. This revenue growth is anticipated to be derived, in large\\npart, by the development of new innovative products and the globalization of the\\nCompany. Domestically, the goal is to introduce at least 30 new products each\\nyear; during 1997, the Company introduced 35 new domestic products and 54 new\\ninternational products. In its international business, the Company has a goal to\\ntriple international sales to $600 million by 1999. During 1997 the Company\\nentered into 25 new international distribution/license agreements. The Company\\nhas also identified new channels of distribution as additional sales growth\\nopportunities, including commercial organizations and \"direct to the consumer\"\\nchannels such as catalogs, the Internet and Sunbeam/registered trademark/\\nfactory outlet stores. These growth plans do not reflect the impact of the\\nCompany\\'s pending acquisitions of The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands\\nUSA, Inc. and First Alert, Inc. See \"PENDING ACQUISITIONS\".\\n\\n\\n     Both international expansion and new product introductions will be\\nsupported by a significant investment in a major new advertising program that is\\ngeared to continually strengthening the Sunbeam/registered trademark/,\\nOster/registered trademark/, Grillmaster/registered trademark/ and other brands\\nin the marketplace.\\n\\n\\nPENDING ACQUISITIONS\\n\\n\\n     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced that it had entered into three\\nseparate agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA,\\nInc. and First Alert, Inc. The three transactions are subject to customary\\nconditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, and are\\nexpected to close early this spring.\\n\\n\\n     The Coleman Company, Inc. (\"Coleman\"), with 1997 revenues of approximately\\n$1.1 billion, is the world\\'s leading manufacturer and marketer of outdoor\\nrecreational products. It manufactures and distributes widely diversified\\nproduct lines for camping, leisure time and hardware markets, under the\\nColeman/registered trademark/, Powermate/registered trademark/, Camping\\nGaz/registered trademark/ and Eastpak/registered trademark/ brand names. The\\nColeman transaction is valued at approximately $2.0 billion, consisting of\\napproximately $811 million in Company common stock, approximately $260 million\\nin cash and the assumption of debt.\\n\\n\\n     Signature Brands USA, Inc. (\"Signature Brands\"), with 1997 revenues of\\napproximately $279 million, is a leading manufacturer of a comprehensive line of\\nconsumer and professional products, including coffee makers marketed under the\\nMr. Coffee/registered trademark/ brand name and consumer health products\\nmarketed under the Health-o-Meter/registered trademark/, Counselor/registered\\ntrademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ brand names. The Signature Brands\\ntransaction is valued at approximately $250 million, consisting of cash and the\\nassumption of debt.\\n\\n\\n     First Alert, Inc. (\"First Alert\"), with revenues of approximately $187\\nmillion, is the worldwide leader in residential safety equipment including smoke\\nand carbon monoxide detectors marketed under the First Alert/registered\\ntrademark/ brand name. The First Alert transaction is valued at approximately\\n$175 million, consisting of cash and the assumption of debt.\\n\\n\\n     In connection with the three transactions, the Company intends to seek to\\nnegotiate a new bank credit facility and to issue other debt securities. See\\n\"Item 7 - Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\\n\\n\\nPRODUCTS\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s core product categories are as follows:\\n\\n\\nAPPLIANCES\\n\\n\\n     Small kitchen appliances including Mixmaster/registered trademark/ stand\\nmixers, hand mixers, Osterizer/registered trademark/ blenders, food processors,\\nrice cookers, food steamers, toasters, can openers, coffee makers, bread\\nmakers, waffle makers, ice cream makers, frying pans, deep fryers and culinary\\naccessories, are sold primarily under the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and\\nOster/registered trademark/ brand names. The Company holds the number one or\\ntwo market positions in blenders, mixers, and bread makers. The Appliance\\ncategory also encompasses garment care appliances consisting of irons and\\nsteamers. Sales of appliances accounted for approximately 32% of the Company\\'s\\ndomestic net sales in 1997.\\n\\n                                       2\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nHEALTH AT HOME\\n\\n\\n     The Company markets its home health products under the Sunbeam/registered\\ntrademark/ name and the trademark Health at Home/registered trademark/. These\\nproducts include heating pads, bath scales, blood pressure and other health-\\nmonitoring instruments, massagers, vaporizers, humidifiers and dental care\\nproducts. This product category also includes the recently introduced\\nAllergySmart/trademark/ air detector and air cleaner and the\\nFreshSource/trademark/ power water filter. Sales of health care products\\naccounted for approximately 10% of the Company\\'s domestic net sales in 1997.\\n\\n\\nPERSONAL CARE AND COMFORT\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s personal care and comfort products include a broad line of\\nelectric blankets, comforters and Cuddle-Up/registered trademark/ heated\\nthrows, shower massagers, and hair clippers and trimmers for animals and humans\\nwhich are sold through retail channels. The Company holds the number one market\\nposition in electric blankets, heated throws and retail hair clippers. Sales of\\npersonal care and comfort products accounted for approximately 18% of the\\nCompany\\'s domestic net sales in 1997.\\n\\n\\nOUTDOOR COOKING\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam is a leading supplier of outdoor barbecue grills. Sunbeam has the\\nleading market share position in the gas grill industry. Barbecue grills\\nconsist of propane, natural gas, electric and charcoal models sold primarily\\nunder the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and Grillmaster/registered trademark/\\nbrand names. Sales of outdoor cooking products accounted for approximately 34%\\nof the Company\\'s domestic net sales in 1997.\\n\\n\\nAWAY FROM HOME\\n\\n\\n     The Company markets a line of professional barber, beauty and animal\\nequipment, including electric and battery clippers, replacement blades and\\nother grooming accessories sold to both\\n\\n\\n                                       3\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nconventional retailers and through professional distributors. In addition, the\\nCompany is expanding the marketing of its appliances, scales and personal care\\nand comfort products to institutional and commercial channels. Sales of away\\nfrom home products accounted for approximately 6% of the\\nCompany\\'s domestic net sales in 1997.\\n\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL\\n\\n\\n     The Company markets a variety of products (primarily small kitchen\\nappliances, personal care and comfort products, grills, professional clippers\\nand related products ) outside the U.S. While the Company sells many of the\\nsame products domestically and internationally, it also sells products designed\\nspecifically to appeal to foreign markets. The Company, through its foreign\\nsubsidiaries, has manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Venezuela, and sales\\noffices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company\\'s\\ninternational products are sourced from the Company\\'s United States, Mexican or\\nVenezuelan manufacturing operations or from vendors primarily located in Asia.\\nInternational sales accounted for approximately 21% of the Company\\'s total net\\nsales in 1997.\\n\\n\\n     To date, the Company\\'s activities outside the United States have been\\nprimarily focused in Mexico, Latin America and Canada. The Company enjoys a\\nstrong market position in a number of product categories in Latin America. The\\nOster/registered trademark/ brand has the leading market share in small\\nappliances in a number of Latin American countries.\\n\\n     The Company\\'s pending acquisitions of Coleman, Signature Brands and First\\nAlert are anticipated to provide new opportunities for international expansion\\nof the Company\\'s activities. See \"Pending Acquisitions\".\\n\\nCOMPETITIVE STRENGTHS\\n\\n\\n     Worldwide, Sunbeam competes in markets with a number of well-established\\nUnited States and foreign companies on the basis of various strengths,\\ndepending on the country, product category and distribution channels. The\\nCompany believes that it is well-positioned to pursue continued growth as a\\nresult of several competitive strengths, which include the following:\\n\\n\\n     DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. The Company has one of the premier mass merchant\\ndistribution networks serving large national retailers in the United States.\\nThe Company also has a strong network of well-established distributors and\\nservice organizations in Latin America. The Company supports its customers\\nneeds with strong warehousing and distribution capabilities, a broad,\\nhigh-quality product portfolio, electronic data interchange (\"EDI\") and\\njust-in-time product delivery capabilities. The Company markets its products\\nthrough virtually every category of retailer including mass merchandisers,\\ncatalog showrooms, warehouse clubs, department stores, catalogues,\\nCompany-owned outlet stores, television shopping channels, hardware stores,\\nhome improvement centers, drug and grocery stores, and pet supply retailers, as\\nwell as independent distributors and military post exchange outlets.\\n\\n\\n     STRONG POSITION IN CONSOLIDATING RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. The consolidation\\ntrend in the retail industry has resulted in the emergence and global expansion\\nof large mass merchandisers that demand financially strong, efficient suppliers\\nwhich offer a broad range of innovative, quality products with the ability to\\nmake timely shipments in large volumes and provide strong customer, promotional\\nand merchandising support. The Company has benefited from this trend and\\nbelieves it has the opportunity to further expand distribution with a number of\\nretailers and increase its penetration of existing\\n\\n\\n                                       4\\n<PAGE>\\n\\naccounts. In 1997, the Company sold products to virtually all of the top 100\\nU.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, Price Costco, Kmart, Target Stores, Home\\nDepot, Sears, Roebuck & Co., Service Merchandise, Menards, Lowe\\'s and J.C.\\nPenney.\\n\\n\\n     BRAND NAME RECOGNITION. The Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and\\nOster/registered trademark/ brands have been household names for generations.\\nThe Company believes that these brands, along with its other well-known\\nsecondary names such as Mixmaster/registered trademark/ and\\nOsterizer/registered trademark/ draw customers into retail stores specifically\\nto purchase products bearing these brand names. During the past year, the\\nCompany has spent over $56 million for advertising and sales promotion to\\nsupport brand recognition.\\n\\n\\n     MARKET LEADERSHIP. The majority of Sunbeam sales are from products in\\nwhich the Company holds the number one or two market share position. The\\nCompany believes that this combination of leading brand-name products and\\nbreadth of product offerings makes Sunbeam an attractive vendor to retailers\\nwho are consolidating their suppliers.\\n\\n\\nCUSTOMERS\\n\\n\\n     The rapid growth of large mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs and\\nchanges in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant\\nconsolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the formation of dominant\\nmulti-category retailers. Sunbeam has positioned itself to respond to the\\nchallenges of this changing retail environment by pursuing strategic\\nrelationships with large, high-volume merchandisers. The Company markets its\\nproducts through virtually every category of retailer including mass\\nmerchandisers, catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs, department stores, hardware\\nstores, catalogues, television shopping channels, home centers, drug and\\ngrocery stores, and pet supply retailers, as well as independent distributors\\nand the military post exchange services. The Company\\'s largest customer,\\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 21% of sales in 1997.\\n\\n\\n     Retailers are pursuing a number of strategies in their competition to\\ndeliver the highest-quality, lowest-cost brand name products. A growing trend\\namong retailers is to purchase on a \"just-in-time\" basis in order to reduce\\ninventory costs and increase returns on investment. This trend has required\\nincreased working capital investments for manufacturers and requires\\nmanufacturers to more closely monitor consumer buying patterns as retailers\\nshorten their lead times for orders. Currently, most Sunbeam products sold to\\nU.S. retailers are manufactured at the Company\\'s own facilities in North\\nAmerica. However, one of the Company\\'s goals for 1998 is to \"source\"\\napproximately fifty percent (50%) of parts and/or products from others,\\nincluding suppliers in Asia, in order to reduce capital investment in plants\\nwhile growing sales volume and to improve operating margins. The Company\\nintends to continue to support its retail partners\\' \"just-in-time\" inventory\\nstrategies through investments in, among other things, improved forecasting\\nsystems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution capabilities and\\nelectronic communications. Currently, Sunbeam has approximately 90% of its U.S.\\ncustomer sales on electronic data interchange (EDI) systems.\\n\\n\\n     The amount of backlog orders at any point in time is not a significant\\nfactor in the Company\\'s business.\\n\\n\\nPATENTS AND TRADEMARKS\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam believes that an integral part of its strength is its ability to\\ncapitalize on the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and Oster/registered trademark/\\ntrademarks which are registered in the United States and in numerous foreign\\ncountries. Widely recognized throughout North America, South and Central\\nAmerica and Europe, these registered trademarks, along with\\nOsterizer/registered trademark/, Mixmaster/registered trademark/, Toast\\nLogic/registered trademark/, Steammaster/registered trademark/,\\nOskar/registered trademark/, Grillmaster/registered trademark/ and Blanket\\nwith a Brain/registered trademark/ brands are important to the success of the\\nCompany\\'s products. Other important trademarks within Sunbeam include Oster\\nDesigner/registered trademark/ line, Cuddle-Up/registered trademark/ and\\nA5/registered trademark/.\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam holds numerous patents covering a wide variety of products, the\\nloss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business taken as a whole.\\n\\n\\n                                       5\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nEMPLOYEES\\n\\n\\n     The Company currently has approximately 3,300 full-time domestic employees\\nand 4,200 international employees. None of the Company\\'s domestic full-time\\nworkforce has union representation. Sunbeam has had no material labor-related\\nwork stoppages and, in the opinion of management, relations with its employees\\nare generally good.\\n\\n\\nSEASONALITY\\n\\n\\n     On a consolidated basis, Sunbeam sales do not exhibit substantial\\nseasonality. However, sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the\\nfirst half of the year, while sales of appliances and personal care and comfort\\nproducts are strongest in the second half of the year. In addition, sales of a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s products, including warming blankets, vaporizers,\\nhumidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.\\nDuring 1997, the Company initiated early buy programs for highly seasonal\\nproducts such as grills and warming blankets in order to more levelize\\nproduction and distribution activities.\\n\\n\\nRAW MATERIALS\\n\\n\\n     The raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company\\'s products are\\navailable from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal\\nrequirements. The Company\\'s primary raw materials include aluminum, steel,\\nresin, copper, and corrugated cardboard for cartons.\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s operations, like those of comparable businesses, are subject\\nto certain federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations\\nin addition to laws and regulations regarding labeling and packaging of\\nproducts and the sale of products containing certain environmentally sensitive\\nmaterials (\"Environmental Laws\"). The Company believes it is in substantial\\ncompliance with all Environmental Laws which are applicable to its operations.\\nCompliance with Environmental Laws involves certain continuing costs; however,\\nsuch costs of ongoing compliance have not resulted, and are not anticipated to\\nresult, in a material increase in the Company\\'s capital expenditures or to have\\na material adverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial\\ncondition or competitive position.\\n\\n\\n     In addition to ongoing environmental compliance at its operations, the\\nCompany also is actively engaged in certain environmental remediation\\nactivities relating primarily to divested operations. As of December 31, 1997,\\nthe Company had been identified by the United States Environmental Protection\\nAgency (\"EPA\") or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible\\nparty (\"PRP\") in connection with seven (7) sites subject to the federal\\nSuperfund law and two (2) sites subject to state Superfund laws comparable to\\nthe federal law (collectively the \"Environmental Sites\"), exclusive of sites at\\nwhich the Company has been designated (or expects to be designated) as a de\\nminimis (less than 1%) participant.\\n\\n\\n     The Superfund Act, and related state environmental remediation laws,\\ngenerally authorize governmental authorities to remediate a Superfund site and\\nto assess the costs against the PRPs or to order the PRPs to remediate the site\\nat their expense. Liability under the Superfund Law is joint and several and is\\nimposed on a strict basis, without regard to degree of negligence or\\nculpability. As a result, the Company recognizes its responsibility to\\ndetermine whether other PRPs at a Superfund site are financially capable of\\npaying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site.\\nWhenever the Company has determined that a particular PRP is not financially\\nresponsible, it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that\\nsuch PRP will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation. To\\nminimize the Company\\'s potential liability with respect to the Environmental\\nSites, the Company has actively participated in steering committees and other\\ngroups of PRPs established with respect to such sites. The Company currently is\\nengaged in active remediation activities at nine (9) sites, four (4) of which\\nare among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and five (5) of which have\\nnot been designated as Superfund sites under federal or state law.\\n\\n\\n                                       6\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n     In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation\\nactivities at a site located in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary\\nformerly conducted operations. The Company has been actively cooperating with\\nthe United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory\\nauthorities in developing and implementing a plan for remediation of this site;\\nwhich remediation is anticipated to be substantially completed in 1998.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s costs for environmental remediation activities have not had\\na material adverse effect on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial\\ncondition or competitive position. The Company has established reserves to\\ncover the anticipated probable costs of remediation, based upon periodic\\nreviews of all sites for which the Company has, or may have, remediation\\nresponsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the amount of such reserves was\\napproximately four percent (4%) of the Company\\'s total liabilities as set forth\\nin the consolidated financial statements. Such environmental reserves do not\\nanticipate any offsets for potential insurance recoveries from certain of the\\nCompany\\'s liability insurance carriers which the Company continues to pursue.\\n\\n\\n     Due to uncertainty over the remedial measures to be adopted at some sites,\\nthe possibility of changes in the Environmental Laws, and the fact that joint\\nand several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and\\nstate Superfund sites, the Company\\'s ultimate future liability with respect to\\nsites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts\\nreserved at fiscal year end 1997. However, the Company believes, based on\\nexisting information, that the costs of completing the environmental\\nremediation of all sites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility\\nhave been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters\\nwill not have a material adverse effect upon the Company\\'s financial condition.\\n \\n\\n\\n     In December 1996, the Company reached a negotiated settlement with the EPA\\nwith regard to a notice of violation concerning the construction and operation\\nof two paint lines at the Company\\'s Neosho, MO facility prior to obtaining the\\nnecessary permits for construction and operation. The negotiated settlement\\namount of $829,825 recognizes the benefits of a \"supplemental environmental\\nproject\" which consisted of the Company\\'s installation of nominal emission\\npowder coating lines to replace solvent paint lines. In October 1997, the\\nCompany executed a Consent Decree documenting the settlement and is awaiting\\nthe EPA\\'s execution of the Consent Decree; the Company anticipates formal\\nresolution of this matter by the second quarter of 1998.\\n\\n\\n     The Company is not a party to any other administrative or judicial\\nproceeding to which a governmental authority is a party and which involves\\npotential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of $100,000 or\\nmore.\\n\\n\\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\\n\\n\\n     Certain of the information contained herein (including Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations)\\ncontains \"forward-looking\" information, as that term is defined in the Private\\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as the same may be amended (herein the\\n\"Act\") and in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\")\\nfrom time to time. Such \"forward-looking\" information may in included herein\\nunder the following captions, among others: Item 1. Business--Restructuring and\\nGrowth Plan, Pending Acquisitions, International, Competitive Strengths,\\nCustomers, Raw Materials, Environmental Matters and Item 7--Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\\n\\n\\n     These Cautionary Statements are being made pursuant to the Act, with the\\nintention of obtaining the benefits of the \"Safe Harbor\" provisions of the Act.\\nThe Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the\\nCompany are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may\\ndiffer materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of\\nvarious factors.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company believes that it has sufficient management resources\\nto complete the pending acquisitions of Coleman, Signature Brands and First\\nAlert without negatively impacting on the Company\\'s ongoing operations. In\\naddition, the Company expects to benefit from various operating synergies\\narising from these acquisitions. If the Company fails to maintain its current\\noperations in the manner anticipated or fails to obtain the expected operating\\nsynergies, such failures could negatively effect the Company\\'s financial and/or\\noperating performance, which effect could be material.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company expects to significantly increase the amount of its\\noutstanding indebtedness and to enter into financing arrangements which may\\ncontain various restrictive covenants, in order to finance the acquisitions of\\nColeman, Signature Brands and First Alert. The continuing cost of\\nservicing such debt could negatively effect the Company\\'s future operations,\\nwhich effect could be material.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company\\'s performance should be expected to be affected by\\nthe strength of the retail economy, primarily in the United States, but also in\\nCanada, Latin America and Asia. Weakness in\\n\\n\\n                                       7\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nconsumer confidence and retail outlets (including the financial weakness or\\nbankruptcy of retail outlets, especially mass merchants) should be expected to\\nadversely impact the Company\\'s future financial results. In addition, the\\nextended credit terms provided by the Company in connection with its \"early buy\"\\nprogram increase the Company\\'s risk of collection of accounts receivable.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company operates in a highly competitive environment with\\nnumerous competitors which are financially strong and capable of competing\\neffectively with the Company in the marketplace. Such competitors may take\\nactions to meet the Company\\'s new product introductions and other initiatives.\\nSome competitors may be willing to accept lower margins and to reduce prices to\\ncompete with the Company. As a result, the Company could fail to achieve\\nanticipated sales increases, to realize anticipated price increases, or\\notherwise fail to meet its anticipated goals. Any of such circumstances would\\nlikely have an adverse effect on future financial performance, which effect\\ncould be material.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures approximately 70% of its\\nproducts. One of the Company\\'s goals for 1998 is to source approximately 50% of\\nthe Company\\'s parts and/or products from third parties. The Company\\'s ability\\nto realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels is dependent upon\\nits ability to timely manufacture, source and deliver products which may be\\nsold for a profit. Labor difficulties, delays in delivery or pricing of raw\\nmaterials and/or sourced products, scheduling and transportation difficulties,\\nmanagement dislocations and delays in development and manufacture of new\\nproducts can negatively affect operating profits. Although the Company will use\\nits best efforts to select suppliers for sourced product which are reliable and\\ndependable, the Company\\'s planned increase in the percentage of sourced\\nproducts will decrease the Company\\'s immediate control of product and, if such\\nsuppliers fail to deliver products as anticipated, could have an adverse effect\\non future financial performance, which effect could be material.\\n\\n     /bullet/ As a consumer goods distributor, the Company\\'s results of\\noperations can be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits, product\\nrecall actions and/or by higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or\\nother returns of goods.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company expects to substantially increase the amount of\\nbusiness conducted by it outside North America. If the Company fails to achieve\\nanticipated market penetration in areas of the world into which the Company\\ncurrently expects to expand its sales, such event is likely to have an adverse\\neffect on the Company\\'s future financial performance, which effect could be\\nmaterial. Expansion of the Company\\'s sales in foreign markets depends upon many\\nfactors, including the states of economies in foreign countries, the strength\\nof consumer demand in those countries for products which the Company sells (or\\nexpects to sell in those markets), the strength of competition from other\\nglobal consumer products companies and other factors which may negatively\\naffect the Company\\'s anticipated performance in those markets. Although the\\nrecent financial instability in Asia has not currently had any material impact\\non the Company, if such conditions continue and/or worsen, they could\\nnegatively impact the Company\\'s ability to achieve anticipated sales growth in\\nsuch countries, the effect of which could be material to the Company\\'s future\\nfinancial performance.\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures some products and has sales in\\nsuch economies as those of Mexico and Venezuela, both of which economies have\\nbeen unstable or hyperinflationary in recent years. The economies of other\\nforeign countries important to the Company\\'s expansion plans, including other\\ncountries in Latin America and Asia, could suffer similar instability in the\\nfuture. Such factors as currency devaluations, new tariffs, changes in monetary\\npolicies, inflation, governmental instability and similar matters could\\nnegatively affect the Company\\'s anticipated performance in foreign markets.\\nAlthough the Company plans to take advantage of recent economic and currency\\nfluctuations in certain Asian countries by increasing the Company\\'s purchases\\nof products from such countries at lower prices, there is no guarantee that\\nsuch purchasing advantage will be fulfilled or will fully overcome any lost\\nsales opportunities in those same countries. As a result, the economic\\nconditions discussed above or any of these circumstances could have an adverse\\neffect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.\\n\\n     /bullet/ A significant portion of the cost of goods manufactured by the\\nCompany in North America is the cost of raw materials and/or components. The\\nCompany has implemented changes in its purchasing\\n\\n\\n                                       8\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nfunction which have enabled the Company to purchase materials more efficiently\\nand economically than it has in the past. The future success of the Company\\'s\\npurchasing initiatives may be affected by many factors beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol, such as commodity pricing generally and higher prices for the specific\\nmaterials required by the Company. Although there are numerous suppliers\\navailable for the materials and components sourced by the Company, any\\nunanticipated change in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the\\nCompany. In addition, the Company\\'s future initiatives to reduce the cost of\\nmaterials simply may not achieve savings in amounts comparable to those\\npreviously obtained by the Company. A significant failure by the Company to\\nmaintain material costs as anticipated would likely have an adverse effect on\\nanticipated future financial performance, which effect could be material.\\n\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company anticipates realizing price increases from time to\\ntime for certain of its products. The Company operates in a highly competitive\\nindustry, and its ability to realize price increases may be limited due to\\ncompetitive pressures. If there is a material failure to realize anticipated\\nprice increases, margins likely will be lower than anticipated by the Company,\\nand this will likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance,\\nwhich effect could be material.\\n\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company anticipates that it will be able to more rapidly\\ndevelop and introduce a substantial number of new and innovative products in\\nthe future. However, the Company may prove unable to meet its more aggressive\\nschedules for future product development. Failure to develop and manufacture\\nnew products in the amounts and with the quality anticipated or a failure to\\nreduce the cycle time for new product introductions would likely have an\\nadverse effect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.\\n \\n\\n\\n     /bullet/ Sales of certain of the Company\\'s products can be negatively\\nimpacted by unseasonable weather conditions during different seasons and\\nquarters of the year. For instance, the Company\\'s sales of warming blankets\\nwere negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 1997 by moderate temperatures\\nin the northern states. The Company has attempted to levelize production,\\nmarketing and other activities related to seasonal products by implementing an\\n\"early buy\" program; such a program shifts certain of the weather related risks\\nof negative sales impact for such seasonal products to later months of the\\nseason and, as result, could have a negative impact on future financial\\nperformance.\\n\\n\\n     /bullet/ The Company has entered into various arrangements with third\\nparties for the provision of back-office administrative services previously\\nprovided with internal resources, including provision of all necessary computer\\nsystems.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\\n        OF OPERATION\\n\\n\\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996\\n\\n\\n     In November 1996, the Company initiated a major restructuring and growth\\nplan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the business\\nin order to restore higher levels of profitability for the Company. By July\\n1997, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. The\\n$225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuring\\nresults primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within the\\nCompany, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities\\n(including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and\\nwarehouses from 61 to 18), the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including\\n3,300 from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below and\\napproximately 2,800 other positions), the centralization of the Company\\'s\\nprocurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting in\\nprocurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished products\\nand the reduction of the Company\\'s product offerings and stock keeping units\\n(\"SKU\\'s\"). The restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of the\\nCompany\\'s core product categories and the elimination of those businesses and\\nproduct lines that did not fit the core categories. Sunbeam\\'s core product\\ncategories are Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, Outdoor\\nCooking and Away From Home. Product categories and businesses determined to be\\nnon-core were divested in 1997, including the Company\\'s furniture business and\\nits time and temperature, decorative bedding and Counselor/registered trademark/\\nand Borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. In addition, the Company\\nsold its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in 1997.\\n\\n\\n     Net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were $1,168.2 million, an\\nincrease of $183.9 million or 18.7% over 1996. Net sales on a normalized basis,\\nafter excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued\\noperations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding and\\nCounselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ branded scales),\\nincreased 22.4% during the year.\\n\\n\\n     Global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five of\\nthe Company\\'s product categories primarily from new product introductions,\\nimproved distribution (particularly with the Company\\'s top ten customers),\\ninternational geographic expansion and improved price realization for certain\\nproducts. Global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25% in the\\nAppliance, Outdoor Cooking and Away From Home categories with sales increases\\nof 26.8%, 27.2% and 28.6%, respectively. Sales in the Health at Home category\\nincreased 10.7% on a normalized basis and sales in the Personal Care and\\nComfort category increased 3.4% during 1997.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s Appliance category sales increases were driven by new\\nproducts, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep\\nfryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass\\nretailers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products increased in 1997 after three\\nstraight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising and\\nadvertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely new\\nline of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in the\\nfourth quarter of 1997 under a new \"early buy\" marketing program that included\\namong other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarter\\nof 1998. The Company sold approximately $50.0 million of Outdoor Cooking\\nProducts under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. The early buy program\\nfor Outdoor Cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels and\\nproduction efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distribution\\nactivities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and to\\ndrive additional retail sell-through of Outdoor Cooking products by reducing the\\nlikelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter\\n1998 selling season.\\n\\n\\n     Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products were up over 30% through\\nSeptember 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lower\\nthan expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets\\nin late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen\\nsized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. The Company anticipates\\nshifting to a more\\n\\n\\n                                       14\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nlevel production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the\\nseasonal demand for bedding products. Health at Home category sales increased\\nas a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.\\nAway from Home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including\\ncordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution of\\ncommercially rated appliances. Also contributing to the Company\\'s sales growth\\nin 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of\\n1997.\\n\\n\\n     International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew\\n31.2% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220\\nvolt product introductions and the execution of 25 new international\\ndistribution and license agreements. Revenue growth of approximately 34% was\\nachieved both in Mexico and by the Company\\'s Latin American export sales\\norganization, and sales in Venezuela and Canada increased approximately 23%\\neach. European sales fell slightly in 1997, however the Company expects that\\nexpanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additional\\nnew distribution agreements will benefit European sales in 1998.\\n\\n\\n     The gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to\\n28.3%. This increase reflects the results of many cost savings and margin\\nenhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the Company\\'s restructuring plan\\ncoupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higher\\nrevenues associated with the Company\\'s growth plan. The Company initiated a\\nmanufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted at\\naggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,\\nincluding the Neosho, Missouri Outdoor Cooking Products facility which suffered\\nfrom poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grill\\nseason. The benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impact\\nfactory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. The\\nrefinement of the Neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiation\\nof production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included a\\nrevised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common parts\\nin the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increase\\ncapacity and throughput.\\n\\n\\n     Operating earnings for 1997 were $199.4 million, an increase of $195.0\\nmillion over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. As a\\npercentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1% increased 16.6 percentage\\npoints above last year\\'s operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. The\\noperating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved gross\\nmargin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\")\\ncosts in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regional\\nheadquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations\\ncenter, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative and\\ndistribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company\\nwide cost control initiatives. In addition, SG&A during 1996 included\\nincremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and\\nother costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higher\\nthan normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiatives\\nrelated to the launch of the Company\\'s growth plan, and higher bad debt\\nexpenses associated with certain of the Company\\'s customers. The cost reduction\\ninitiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997\\nresulted in SG&A decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4% in 1996\\n(excluding the impact of special charges) to 11.2% for 1997.\\n\\n\\n     Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in\\n1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due to\\nimproved cash flows.\\n\\n\\n     The effective income tax of 35% for 1997 and 1996 for earnings (loss) from\\ncontinuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as a\\nresult of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits and\\nloss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain state\\nincome tax credits.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was\\n$1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of\\n$2.37. The Company\\'s share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share\\ncalculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an increase\\nin the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents\\noutstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value of\\nthe Company\\'s common stock in 1997.\\n\\n\\n                                       15\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n     The Company\\'s discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March\\n1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the\\nsale and break-even earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture operations\\nhad net income of $.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated\\nloss on disposal of the business of $32.4 million, net of applicable income tax\\nbenefits. The sale of the Company\\'s furniture business assets (primarily\\ninventory, property, plant and equipment) was completed in March 1997.\\n\\n\\n     The Company received $69 million in cash and retained accounts receivable\\nrelated to the furniture business of approximately $50.0 million as of the\\nclosing date. The final purchase price for the furniture business was subject\\nto a post-closing adjustment based on the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement\\nand in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the Company\\nrecorded an additional loss on disposal of $13.7 million, net of income tax\\nbenefits.

The special charge to earnings\\nin 1996 is included in the following categories on the consolidated statement\\nof operations (in millions):\\n\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                         PRE-TAX DOLLAR        AFTER-TAX\\n                                                             AMOUNT         PER SHARE AMOUNT\\n                                                        ----------------   -----------------\\n<S>                                                     <C>                <C>\\nRestructuring, impairment and other costs ...........       $  154.9            $ (1.21)\\nCost of sales .......................................           92.3              (0.72)\\nSelling, general and administrative .................           42.5              (0.33)\\nEstimated loss from discontinued operations .........           47.9              (0.39)\\n                                                            --------            -------\\nTotal ...............................................       $  337.6            $ (2.65)\\n                                                            ========            =======\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n     Net sales from continuing operations of $984.2 million for 1996 represents\\na decrease of $32.7 million, or 3.2%, from 1995. The Company experienced a loss\\nfrom continuing operations of $196.7 million or $2.37 per share for 1996 versus\\nearnings from continuing operations of $37.6 million or $.45 per share\\n(diluted) in 1995 primarily as a result of the restructuring activities\\ndiscussed above. The net loss for 1996 was $228.3 million, or $2.75 per share,\\ncompared to net earnings of $50.5 million, or $0.61 per share (diluted), for\\n1995. Excluding the impact of special charge items for 1996, earnings from\\ncontinuing operations before income taxes decreased from $60.6 million in 1995\\nto a loss of $12.9 million in 1996.\\n\\n\\n     Domestic sales represented approximately 80% of total sales of the Company\\nin 1996 and decreased $28.5 million or 3.4% from 1995. This sales decline was\\ndriven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3% and\\nlower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0% from 1995, primarily as\\nresult of lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December 1996). Domestic\\nsales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products\\nsuch as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on\\nbreadmakers. Sales of other product categories such as health and personal care\\nproducts and time and temperature products (divested in March 1997) were either\\nflat or declined slightly from 1995 levels.\\n\\n\\n     International sales decreased $4.2 million or 2.2% from 1995 primarily as\\na result of lower sales in Latin America due to political and/or economic\\ninstability in several countries such as Ecuador, Peru, Columbia and Venezuela\\n(which suffered a bolivar devaluation in April 1996), a sales decline of 11.2%\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nin Canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the Company\\'s then largest\\nCanadian customer offset by a 55.0% increase in sales in Mexico as a result of\\na more stable economic environment in 1996.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of special\\ncharges, was 17.9% of sales in 1996, down from 20.4% in 1995, primarily from\\nthe underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing\\ncapacity that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond by the Company\\'s\\nrestructuring and growth plan cost reduction initiatives.\\n\\n\\n     Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, excluding the\\nimpact of special charges described above, were 17.6% of sales in 1996\\nprimarily as a result of an inflated cost structure that has been realigned for\\n1997 and beyond. In addition, a $12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 media\\nadvertising campaign and one-time expenditures for market research, new\\npackaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normal\\nSG&A spending in 1996. Also included in 1996 SG&A costs were $7.7 million of\\ncompensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards made in connection\\nwith the employment of a new senior management team.\\n\\n\\n     Interest expense for 1996 increased from $9.4 million in 1995 to $13.6\\nmillion as a result of increased indebtedness of the Company for working\\ncapital requirements and non-recurring capitalized interest in 1995 related to\\nthe construction of the Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center.\\n\\n\\n     The effective income tax rate for 1996 decreased 3 percentage points from\\n1995 to 35.0% as a result of certain foreign and state operating losses for\\nwhich no tax benefits were recorded and the non-deductibility of compensation\\nexpense related to restricted stock awards.\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s discontinued furniture operations had revenues of $227.5\\nmillion in 1996, up 22.6% from $185.6 million in 1995. This revenue growth was\\nthe result of the acquisition of the Samsonite/registered trademark/ furniture\\nbusiness in November 1995. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture\\nbusiness sales declined 2.1%. Earnings from the discontinued furniture\\noperations, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $.8 million in\\n1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,\\nunderabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. In\\naddition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsonite/registered\\ntrademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,\\nparticularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.\\n\\n\\nFOREIGN OPERATIONS\\n\\n\\n     During 1997 approximately 90% of the Company\\'s business was conducted in\\nU.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export\\nsales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority\\nof European sales). The Company\\'s exposure to market risk from changes in\\nforeign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company\\'s\\nnon-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in\\nMexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary\\neconomy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and Mexico reverted to\\nhyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation\\nadjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are included\\nas a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were not material\\nto 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.\\n\\n\\n     On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign\\nexchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures\\nthat arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are\\nentered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did\\nnot have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial results in 1995, 1996 and\\n1997. See Note 4 to the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\n\\n     As of December 28, 1997, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of\\n$52.4 million and total debt of $195.2 million. Cash used in operating\\nactivities during 1997 was $8.2 million compared to $14.2\\n\\n\\n                                       17\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nmillion provided by operating activities in 1996. This decrease is primarily\\nattributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in 1997 and the\\nutilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the Company\\'s\\nrestructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales\\nin 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997\\nnecessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the Company\\'s\\ninitiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expenditures\\nrequired to implement the restructuring plan. In addition, cash used in\\noperating activities reflects $59 million of proceeds from the sale of trade\\naccounts receivable under the Company\\'s revolving trade accounts receivable\\nsecuritization program entered into in December 1997 as more fully described in\\nNote 3 to the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n\\n     Capital spending totaled $58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for new\\nproducts, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. Capital spending\\nin 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinued\\nfurniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new product\\ndevelopment, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansion\\nfinanced with a capital lease. Capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately\\n$59.4 million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million related\\nto new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinued\\nfurniture business. The remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost\\nreduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance\\nincluding $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cooking\\nproducts. The Company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%\\nof sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions\\nand certain facility rationalization initiatives.\\n\\n\\n     Cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million in\\nproceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined to\\nbe non-core to the Company\\'s ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996\\nrestructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the\\npurchase of a portion of the Company\\'s furniture business, which was\\nsubsequently divested in full in March 1997.\\n\\n\\n     Cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 and\\nreflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company\\'s revolving credit\\nfacility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture\\noperations and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the\\nexercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the\\nCompany. In 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million was\\nprimarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to support\\nworking capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in new\\nissuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of\\ntreasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In July 1997, the Company\\nreduced the amount of available borrowings under its September 1996 unsecured\\nfive year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250 million.\\n\\n\\n     The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantially\\nall related to previously divested operations. In connection with the Company\\'s\\nrestructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures was\\nundertaken and the Company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and\\nsettlement of certain environmental claims. This review and change in strategy\\nresulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more\\nfully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In\\nmanagement\\'s opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters\\nwill not have a material adverse effect upon the Company\\'s financial condition.\\n\\n\\n     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced the signing of definitive\\nagreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. and\\nFirst Alert, Inc. Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the\\nsecond quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including\\nregulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. In connection with the\\nacquisitions, the Company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt of\\nthe acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existing\\nlong-term debt. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of the\\nacquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolving\\nand term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrent\\nwith the acquisition closings. Refer to Note 14 for additional information\\nregarding the pending acquisitions.\\n\\n\\n     The Company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash\\nequivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds of\\nthe anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient to\\nsupport working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisition\\nrelated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n                                       18\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\n\\n\\n     See Note 1 to the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements for a\\ndiscussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 130,\\nREPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME and SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF\\nAN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, both of which are required to be adopted\\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.

OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\n\\nORGANIZATION\\n\\n\\n     Sunbeam Corporation (\"Sunbeam\" or the \"Company\") is a leading manufacturer\\nand marketer of branded consumer products. The Sunbeam/registered trademark/\\nand Oster/registered trademark/ brands have been household names for\\ngenerations, and the Company is a market share leader in many of its product\\ncategories.\\n\\n\\n     The Company markets its products through virtually every category of\\nretailer including mass merchandisers, catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs,\\ndepartment stores, catalogs, television shopping channels, Company-owned outlet\\nstores, hardware stores, home centers, drug and grocery stores, pet supply\\nretailers, as well as independent distributors and the military. The Company\\nalso sells its products to commercial end users such as hotels and other\\ninstitutions.\\n\\n\\n     Approximately 79% of total Company sales are generated in the United\\nStates. The remaining sales are generated primarily in Latin America, Mexico,\\nCanada, Europe and Asia.\\n\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\\n\\n\\n     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company\\nand all majority-owned subsidiaries that it controls. All material intercompany\\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF FISCAL PERIODS\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. Fiscal\\nyears 1997, 1996 and 1995 ended on December 28, 1997, December 29, 1996, and\\nDecember 31, 1995 respectively, which encompassed 52-week periods.\\n\\n\\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\\n\\n\\n     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from\\nthose estimates. Significant accounting estimates include the establishment of\\nthe allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for product warranty, product\\nliability, excess and obsolete inventory, litigation and environmental\\nexposures.\\n\\n\\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\\n\\n\\n     Substantially all of the Company\\'s trade receivables are due from\\nretailers and distributors located throughout the United States, Latin America\\nand Canada. Approximately 36% of the Company\\'s sales in 1997 were to its five\\nlargest customers. The Company establishes its credit policies based on an\\nongoing evaluation of its customers\\' creditworthiness and competitive market\\nconditions and establishes its allowance for doubtful accounts based on an\\nassessment of exposures to credit losses at each balance sheet date. The\\nCompany believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient based on the\\ncredit exposures outstanding at December 28, 1997. However, certain retailers\\nfiled for bankruptcy protection in the last several years and it is possible\\nthat additional credit losses could be incurred if the trends of retail\\nconsolidation continue.\\n\\n                                      F-7\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n1.

The Company provides for\\ndepreciation using primarily the straight-line method in amounts that allocate\\nthe cost of property, plant and equipment over the following useful lives:\\n\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<S>                                                 <C>\\n       Buildings and improvements ...............   20 to 40 years\\n       Machinery, equipment and tooling .........    3 to 15 years\\n       Furniture and fixtures ...................    3 to 10 years\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n     Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the\\nshorter of its estimated useful life or the term of the lease.\\n\\n\\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\\n\\n\\n     The Company accounts for long-lived assets pursuant to Statement of\\nFinancial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT\\nOF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF. See Notes 8\\nand 9 for a discussion of asset impairment charges in 1996.\\n\\n\\nCAPITALIZED INTEREST\\n\\n\\n     Interest costs for the construction of certain long-term assets are\\ncapitalized and amortized over the related assets\\' estimated useful lives.\\nTotal interest costs during 1997 and 1996 amounted to $12.3 million and $14.0\\nmillion respectively, of which $.9 million and $.4 million respectively, was\\ncapitalized into the construction cost of the long-term assets.\\n\\n\\nAMORTIZATION PERIODS\\n\\n\\n     Trademarks and trade names are being amortized on a straight-line basis\\nover 40 years.\\n\\n\\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\\n\\n\\n     The Company recognizes revenues from product sales principally at the time\\nof shipment to customers. In limited circumstances, at the customers request\\nthe Company may sell seasonal product on a bill and hold basis provided that\\nthe goods are completed, packaged and ready for shipment, such goods are\\nsegregated and the risks of ownership and legal title have passed to the\\ncustomer. The amount of such bill and hold sales at December 29, 1997 was\\napproximately 3% of consolidated revenues.\\n\\n\\n     Net sales is comprised of gross sales less provisions for expected\\ncustomer returns, discounts, promotional allowances and cooperative\\nadvertising.\\n\\n\\nWARRANTY COSTS\\n\\n\\n     The Company provides for warranty costs in amounts it estimates will be\\nneeded to cover future warranty obligations for products sold during the year.\\nEstimates of warranty costs are periodically reviewed and adjusted, when\\nnecessary, to consider actual experience.\\n\\n                                      F-8\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n1.

Income and expense items are\\nconverted into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the\\nyear.\\n\\n\\n     For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, (Venezuela\\nand Mexico) inventories and property, plant and equipment are translated at the\\nrate of exchange on the date the assets were acquired, while other assets and\\nliabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.

OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED)\\n\\nEARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK\\n\\n\\n     In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. Basic\\nearnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing earnings\\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of\\ncommon stock. Diluted earnings per share are determined by dividing earnings\\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of\\ncommon stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding (all related to\\noutstanding stock options and restricted stock discussed in Note 5). The\\nCompany\\'s reported primary earnings per share for 1995 has been restated to\\ncomply with the requirements of SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128 had no impact on the\\nCompany\\'s reported loss per share for 1996 and no impact on the diluted\\nearnings per share reported in 1995. The effect of this accounting change on\\npreviously reported earnings per share (EPS) for 1995 was as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<S>                                                   <C>\\n      Earnings per share from continuing operations\\n       Primary EPS as reported ....................    $  0.45\\n       Effect of SFAS No. 128 .....................       0.01\\n       Basic EPS as restated ......................       0.46\\n      Earnings per share\\n       Primary EPS as reported ....................    $  0.61\\n       Effect of SFAS No. 128 .....................       0.01\\n       Basic EPS as restated ......................       0.62\\n</TABLE>\\n\\nRECLASSIFICATION\\n\\n\\n     Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1997\\npresentation.\\n\\n\\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\n\\n\\n     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued\\nSFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS No. 130 establishes\\nstandards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components\\nin the financial statements. SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years\\nbeginning after December 15, 1997. Reclassification of financial statements for\\nearlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required.

The adoption of SFAS No.\\n130 will have no impact on the Company\\'s consolidated results of operations,\\nfinancial position or cash flows.\\n\\n\\n     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF\\nAN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for\\nthe way that public business enterprises report information about operating\\nsegments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises\\nreport selected information about operating segments in interim financial\\nreports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related\\ndisclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.\\nSFAS No. 131 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning\\nafter December 15, 1997.

At December 28, 1997 there were 9,404,068 shares of common stock\\nreserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options.\\n\\n\\n     In June 1995, the Company retired 7,376,395 shares of common stock held in\\ntreasury, and such shares were returned to the status of authorized but\\nunissued shares. As a result, $103.7 million assigned to treasury stock has\\nbeen eliminated with a corresponding decrease to common stock, paid-in capital\\nand retained earnings. In 1995, the Company repurchased 905,600 shares of its\\ncommon stock at a total cost of $13.1 million.\\n\\n\\n     In July 1996, the Company sold 321,786 shares of common stock for total\\nproceeds of approximately $4.4 million, and granted 1,100,000 shares of\\nrestricted stock in connection with the employment of a new Chairman and Chief\\nExecutive Officer and certain other officers of the Company. Compensation\\nexpense attributable to the restricted stock awards is being amortized to\\nexpense beginning in 1996 over the periods in which the restrictions lapse\\n(which in the case of 333,333 shares, was immediately upon the date of grant,\\nin the case of 666,667 shares, is equally over two years from the date of grant\\nand in the case of the remaining restricted shares, is equally over three years\\nfrom the dates of grant).\\n\\n\\n     On February 20, 1998 the Company entered into new three-year employment\\nagreements with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and two other senior\\nofficers of the Company.

The Notes are guaranteed by the Company\\nand the Hattiesburg Loan is secured by the Hattiesburg facility.\\n\\n\\n     In September 1996 (as subsequently amended), the Company entered into a\\n$500 million syndicated unsecured five year revolving credit facility (the\\n\"Credit Agreement\") which replaced a previous credit facility of $500 million.\\nIn July 1997, the Company reduced the amount of available borrowings under the\\nfacility to $250 million. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company can borrow\\nunder a competitive bid option, or at a spread above LIBOR (currently .5%) or\\nat a bank base rate. In addition, the Company pays an annual facility fee\\n(currently .25%). The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants.\\n\\n                                      F-12\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n3. CREDIT FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n     During 1997, the Company repaid $12.2 million of long-term borrowings\\nrelated to the divested furntiture operations and other assets sold.\\n\\n\\n     The aggregate annual principal payments on long-term debt, excluding\\namounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, due in each of the years\\n1998-2002, are $.7 million, $7.5 million, $7.6 million, $7.6 million and $7.7\\nmillion, respectively.\\n\\n\\n     Long-term debt at the end of each fiscal year consists of the following\\n(in thousands):\\n\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                                                                1997          1996\\n                                                                            -----------   -----------\\n<S>                                                                         <C>           <C>\\n   Revolving credit facility, weighted average interest rate of 5.99% and\\n    5.60% for 1997, and for 1996, respectively ..........................    $110,000      $105,000\\n   Hattiesburg industrial revenue bond due 2009, fixed interest rate\\n    of 7.85% ............................................................      75,000        75,000\\n   Other long-term borrowings, due through 2012, weighted average\\n    interest rate of 3.92% and 4.95%, at December 28, 1997 and\\n    December 29, 1996, respectively .....................................      10,248        22,036\\n                                                                             --------      --------\\n                                                                             $195,248      $202,036\\n                                                                             ========      ========\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n     In December 1997, the Company entered into a revolving trade accounts\\nreceivable securitization program to sell without recourse, through a\\nwholly-owned subsidiary, certain trade accounts receivable. The maximum amount\\nof receivables that can be sold through this program is $70 million. At December\\n28, 1997, the Company had received approximately $59 million from the sale of\\ntrade accounts receivable. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce\\nborrowings under the Company\\'s revolving credit facility. Costs of the program,\\nwhich primarily consist of the purchaser\\'s financing cost of issuing commercial\\npaper backed by the receivables, totaled $.2 million during 1997, and have been\\nclassified as interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of\\nOperations. The Company, as agent for the purchaser of the receivables, retains\\ncollection and administrative responsibilities for the purchased receivables.\\n\\n\\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\n\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\n\\n     The carrying amounts of the Company\\'s financial instruments as of December\\n28, 1997 approximate market values based upon the following methods and\\nassumptions:\\n\\n\\n     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS--The carrying amount of cash and cash\\nequivalents is assumed to approximate fair value as cash equivalents include\\nall highly liquid, short-term investments with original maturities of three\\nmonths or less.\\n\\n\\n     SHORT AND LONG TERM DEBT--The carrying value of the Company\\'s various debt\\noutstanding as of December 28, 1997 approximates market. The fair value of the\\nCompany\\'s fixed rate debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis,\\nbased upon the market yield of public debt securities of comparable credit\\nquality and maturity. The carrying value of the Company\\'s variable rate debt is\\nassumed to approximate market based upon periodic adjustments of the interest\\nrate to the current market rate in accordance with the terms of the debt\\nagreements.\\n\\n                                      F-13\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n     LETTERS OF CREDIT--The Company utilizes stand-by letters of credit to back\\ncertain financing instruments and insurance policies and commercial letters of\\ncredit guaranteeing various international trade activities. The contract\\namounts of the letters of credit approximate their fair value.\\n\\n\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\n\\n     The Company selectively uses derivatives to manage interest rate and\\nforeign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. The use\\nof derivatives did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s results of\\noperations in 1997, 1996 and 1995. No derivatives are entered into for trading\\nor speculative purposes. Foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used\\nto hedge a portion of the Company\\'s underlying exposures denominated in foreign\\ncurrency. Although the market value of derivative contracts at any single point\\nin time will vary with changes in interest and/or foreign exchange rates, the\\ndifference between the carrying value and fair value of such contracts at\\nDecember 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995 is not considered to be material,\\neither individually or in the aggregate. The Company had no derivative\\nfinancial instruments outstanding at December 28, 1997. The Company enters into\\nderivative contracts with counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy.\\nThe Company does not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.\\n\\n\\n     As of December 28, 1996, $10.0 million of the Company\\'s outstanding\\nfloating rate debt was subject to interest rate swap agreements.\\n\\n\\n     In order to mitigate the transaction exposures that may arise from changes\\nin foreign exchange rates, the Company purchases foreign currency option\\ncontracts to hedge anticipated transactions. The option contracts typically\\nexpire within one year. Any realized gains on options are not deferred but are\\nrecognized in income in the period when the hedged exposure is recognized. The\\nCompany purchased options with a notional value of $16.6 million in 1997, $18.2\\nmillion in 1996 and $11.7 million in 1995. Options with notional value of $17.9\\nmillion, $25.4 million and $3.2 million expired in 1997, 1996 and 1995,\\nrespectively. The Company held purchased option contracts with a notional value\\nof $1.4 million at December 29, 1996.\\n\\n\\n5. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS\\n\\n\\n     The Company has one stock-based compensation plan, the Amended and\\nRestated Sunbeam Corporation Stock Option Plan (the \"Plan\"). Under the Plan,\\nall employees are eligible for grants of options to purchase up to an aggregate\\nof 11,300,000 shares of the Company\\'s common stock at an exercise price equal\\nto or in excess of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The\\nterm of each option commences on the date of grant and expires on the tenth\\nanniversary of the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a\\nthree to five year period.\\n\\n\\n     The Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards of up to\\n200,000 shares, in the aggregate, to employees and non-employee directors. See\\nNote 2 for a discussion of restricted stock awards made outside the Plan.\\n\\n\\n     In July 1996, options to purchase an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares (of\\nwhich 2,750,000 options were outstanding at December 28, 1997) were granted\\noutside of the Plan at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the\\nCompany\\'s common stock on the dates of grant in connection with the employment\\nof a new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive\\nofficers of the Company. These outstanding options have terms of ten years and,\\nwith respect to options for 2,500,000 shares, are\\n\\n                                      F-14\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n5.

Options\\nfor the remaining 250,000 shares still outstanding are exercisable in three\\nannual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the July 22, 1996\\ngrant date. On February 20, 1998 the vesting provisions of the options granted\\noutside the Plan were accelerated as further described in Note 14.\\n\\n\\n     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in\\naccounting for its stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been\\nrecognized for outstanding stock options. Had compensation cost for the\\nCompany\\'s outstanding stock options been determined based on the fair value at\\nthe grant dates for those options consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company\\'s\\nnet earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share would have been\\nreduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands except per share\\namounts):\\n\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                            1997            1996            1995\\n                                       -------------   --------------   ------------\\n<S>                                    <C>             <C>              <C>\\n   Net earnings/(loss)\\n    As reported ....................     $ 109,415       $ (228,262)      $ 50,511\\n    Pro forma ......................     $  94,887       $ (238,186)      $ 49,731\\n   Diluted earnings/(loss) per share\\n    As reported ....................     $    1.25       $    (2.75)      $   0.61\\n    Pro forma ......................     $    1.08       $    (2.87)      $   0.60\\n\\n</TABLE>\\n\\n     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant\\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\\nweighted-average assumptions:\\n\\n\\n<TABLE>\\n<CAPTION>\\n                                            1997          1996          1995\\n                                        -----------   -----------   -----------\\n<S>                                     <C>           <C>           <C>\\n   Expected volatility ..............   34.19%        36.78%        36.78%\\n   Risk-free interest rate ..........    6.36%         6.34%         6.34%\\n   Dividend yield ...................      .1%           .1%           .1%\\n   Expected life ....................   6 years       5 years       5 years\\n \\n</TABLE>\\n\\n\\n                                      F-15\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n5.

RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS\\n\\n\\n     In November 1996, the Company announced the details of its restructuring\\nand growth plan. The cost reduction phase of the plan included the\\nconsolidation of administrative functions within the Company, the\\nrationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities, the centralization\\nof the Company\\'s procurement function, and reduction of the Company\\'s product\\nofferings and stock keeping units (\"SKU\\'s\"). The Company also announced plans\\nto divest several lines of business which it determined are not core for\\nSunbeam (see Note 9).\\n\\n\\n     In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company consolidated six\\ndivisional and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide\\ncorporate headquarters in Delray Beach, Florida and outsourced certain back\\noffice activities resulting in a 50% reduction in total\\nback-office/administrative headcount. Overall, the restructuring plan calls for\\na reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and the\\nelimination of over 6,000 positions from the Company\\'s workforce, including\\n3,300 from the disposition of non-core business operations and the elimination\\nof approximately 2,800 other positions. The Company completed the major phases\\nof the restructuring plan by January 1997.\\n\\n\\n     In conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring and growth\\nplan, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge to earnings of\\napproximately $337.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. This amount is\\nallocated as follows in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations:\\n$154.9 million to Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs as further\\ndescribed below; $92.3 million to Cost of Goods Sold related principally to\\ninventory write-downs from the reduction in SKU\\'s and costs of inventory\\nliquidation programs; $42.5 million to Selling, General and Administrative\\nexpenses principally for increases in environmental and litigation reserves\\n(see Note 12) and other reserve categories; and the estimated pre-tax loss on\\nthe divestiture of the Company\\'s furniture business of approximately $47.9\\nmillion. During the first quarter of 1997, upon completion of the sale, the\\nCompany provided for additional losses on the disposal of the furniture\\nbusiness of $13.7 million, net of applicable income tax benefits as a result of\\nlower than anticipated sales proceeds.\\n\\n                                      F-21\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n8. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n     Amounts included in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in 1996 in\\nthe accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations include cash items such\\nas severance and other employee costs of $43.0 million, lease obligations and\\nother exit costs associated with facility closures of $12.6 million, $7.5\\nmillion of start-up costs on back office outsourcing initiatives and other\\ncosts related to the implementation of the restructuring and growth plan.\\nNon-cash Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in 1996 include $91.8\\nmillion related to asset write-downs to net realizable value for disposals of\\nexcess facilities and equipment and non-core product lines, write-offs of\\nredundant computer systems from the administrative back-office consolidations\\nand outsourcing initiatives and intangible, packaging and other asset\\nwrite-downs related to exited product lines and SKU reductions.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\\n\\n\\n     As part of the restructuring plan and redefinition of its core businesses,\\nthe Company also announced the divestiture of the furniture business, by a sale\\nof assets. In February 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the\\nbusiness to U.S. Industries, Inc. which was completed on March 17, 1997. In\\nconnection with the sale of these assets (primarily inventory, property, plant\\nand equipment), the Company received $69 million in cash. The Company retained\\naccounts receivable related to the furniture business of approximately $50.0\\nmillion as of the closing date.\\n\\n\\n     In connection with the furniture divestiture, the Company recorded a\\nprovision for estimated losses to be incurred on the sale of $32.4 million in\\n1996, net of applicable income tax benefits and an additional loss of $13.7\\nmillion, net of applicable income tax benefits in the first quarter of 1997 as a\\nresult of lower than anticipated sales proceeds. Earnings from the discontinued\\nfurniture business were $.8 million in 1996 and $12.9 million in 1995, net of\\napplicable income taxes of $.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Earnings\\nfrom the discontinued furniture business in 1997 were not material. Revenues for\\nthe discontinued furniture business were $51.6 million in 1997, $227.5 million\\nin 1996 and $185.6 million in 1995.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\n\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\\n\\n\\n     The Company\\'s operations, like those of comparable businesses, are subject\\nto certain federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and\\nregulations. As of December 28, 1997, the Company had been identified as a\\npotentially responsible party (\"PRP\") in connection with seven sites subject to\\nthe federal Superfund law and two sites subject to state Superfund laws\\ncomparable to the federal law (collectively the \"Environmental Sites\"),\\nexclusive of sites at which the Company has been designated (or expects to be\\ndesignated) as a de minimis (less than 1%) participant. Substantially all of\\nthese sites relate to divested operations of the Company.\\n\\n\\n     The Company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine\\nsites, four of which are among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and\\nfive of which have not been designated as Superfund sites under federal or\\nstate law. In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation\\nactivities at a site in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary formerly\\nconducted\\n\\n                                      F-25\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES--(CONTINUED)\\n\\noperations. The Company has been actively cooperating with the United States\\nNuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory authorities in developing a\\nplan for remediation of this site; which remediation is expected to be\\nsubstantially completed during 1998.\\n\\n\\n     The Company has established reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5,\\nAccounting for Contingencies, to cover the anticipated probable costs of\\nremediation, based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the Company\\nhas, or may have remediation responsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the\\namount of such reserves was less than 5% of the Company\\'s total liabilities as\\nset forth in the consolidated financial statements. Liability under the\\nSuperfund law is joint and several and is imposed on a strict basis, without\\nregard to degree of negligence or culpability. As a result, the Company\\nrecognizes its responsibility to determine whether other PRP\\'s at a Superfund\\nsite are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate\\ncost of remediation of the site. Whenever the Company has determined that a\\nparticular PRP is not financially responsible, it has assumed for purposes of\\nestablishing reserve amounts that such PRP will not pay its respective share of\\nthe costs of remediation. To minimize the Company\\'s potential liability with\\nrespect to the Environmental Sites, the Company has actively participated in\\nsteering committees and other groups of PRP\\'s established with respect to such\\nsites. The Company continues to pursue the recovery of some environmental\\nremediation costs from certain of its liability insurance carriers; however,\\nsuch potential recoveries have not been offset against potential liabilities\\nand have not been considered in determining the Company\\'s environmental\\nreserves.\\n\\n\\n     Due to uncertainty over remedial measures to be adopted at some sites, the\\npossibility of changes in environmental laws and regulations and the fact that\\njoint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at\\nfederal and state Superfund sites, the Company\\'s ultimate future liability with\\nrespect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the\\namounts reserved as of December 28, 1997. In connection with the Company\\'s\\nrestructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 1996 a comprehensive review of all\\nenvironmental exposures was performed, and the Company accelerated its strategy\\nfor the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. As a result,\\nthe Company recorded additional environmental reserves of approximately $9.0\\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 1996. The Company believes, based on existing\\ninformation, that the costs of completing environmental remediation of all\\nsites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility have been\\nadequately reserved, and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not\\nhave a material adverse effect upon the Company\\'s financial condition.\\n\\n\\nLEASES\\n\\n\\n     The Company rents certain facilities, equipment and retail stores under\\noperating leases. Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $7.4 million\\nin 1997, $8.0 million for 1996 and $8.6 million for 1995. The minimum future\\nrentals due under noncancelable operating leases as of December 28, 1997\\naggregated $30.9 million. The amounts payable in each of the years 1998-2002 and\\nthereafter are $4.8 million, $4.6 million, $4.2 million, $3.9 million, $3.4\\nmillion and $10.0 million, respectively.\\n\\n\\nCERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS\\n\\n\\n     Responsibility for servicing certain debt obligations of the Company\\'s\\npredecessor were assumed by third parties in connection with the acquisition of\\nformer businesses, although the Company\\'s predecessor remained the primary\\nobligor in accordance with the respective loan documents.

Annually, the\\nCompany sets its product liability insurance program based on the Company\\'s\\ncurrent and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of\\ninsurance. The Company\\'s program for 1997 was comprised of a self-insurance\\nretention of $1 million per occurrence.\\n\\n\\n     Cumulative amounts estimated to be payable by the Company with respect to\\npending and potential claims for all years in which the Company is liable under\\nits self-insurance retention have been accrued as liabilities. Such accrued\\nliabilities are necessarily based on estimates (which include actuarial\\ndeterminations made by independent actuarial consultants as to liability\\nexposure, taking into account prior experience, numbers of claims and other\\nrelevant factors); thus, the Company\\'s ultimate liability may exceed or be less\\nthan the amounts accrued. The methods of making such estimates and establishing\\nthe resulting liability are reviewed continually and any adjustments resulting\\ntherefrom are reflected in current operating results.\\n\\n\\n     Historically, product liability awards have rarely exceeded the Company\\'s\\nindividual per occurrence self-insured retention. There can be no assurance,\\nhowever, that the Company\\'s future product liability experience will be\\nconsistent with its past experience. Based on existing information, the Company\\nbelieves that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending product liability\\nclaims and lawsuits of the Company, individually or in the aggregate, will not\\nhave a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of\\noperations of the Company.\\n\\n                                      F-27\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\n\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\\n13.

If the Executive and the\\nCompany cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and\\nthe Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and\\nthose two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm\\nto serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of\\ndetermining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other\\npayments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection\\nwith a Change in Control or the Executive\\'s termination of employment (whether\\npursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or\\nagreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in\\nControl or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be\\ntreated as \"parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the\\nCode, and all \"excess parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 280G of\\nthe Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of\\ntax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole\\nor in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject\\nto the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income\\ntax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the\\nGross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest\\nmarginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive\\'s residence\\non the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes\\nwhich could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the\\nevent the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount\\nused to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the\\ncase may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax\\nor such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate\\nprovided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.\\n\\n                  9. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate\\namounts payable pursuant to Section 7 hereof by seeking other employment or\\n\\n                                       14\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\notherwise, nor shall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a)\\nany remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or\\n(b) any claims the Company may have against the Executive.\\n\\n                  10.

Following the\\nDate of Termination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent\\n(5%) of any publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof.\\nIf, at any time, the provisions of this Section 10(c) shall be determined to be\\ninvalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area,\\nduration or scope of activity, this Section 10(c) shall be considered divisible\\nand shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and\\nscope of activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the\\ncourt or other body having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive\\nagrees that this Section 10(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as\\nthough any invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.

GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive receives any\\npayment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or benefits\\npursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a \"Payment\") that is subject to the\\nexcise tax (the \"Excise Tax\") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of\\n1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), the Company shall pay to the Executive, as soon\\nthereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a \"Gross-Up Payment\") such that\\nthe net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax\\nimposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise\\nTax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment. The\\ndetermination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or\\nbenefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment\\nshall be made by an independent auditor (the \"Auditor\") jointly selected by the\\nCompany and the Executive and paid by the Company. If the Executive and the\\nCompany cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and\\nthe Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and\\nthose two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm\\nto serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of\\ndetermining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other\\npayments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection\\nwith a Change in Control or the Executive\\'s termination of employment (whether\\npursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or\\nagreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in\\nControl or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be\\ntreated as \"parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the\\nCode, and all \"excess parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 280G of\\nthe Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of\\ntax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole\\nor in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject\\nto the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income\\ntax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the\\nGross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest\\nmarginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive\\'s residence\\non the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes\\nwhich could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the\\nevent the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount\\nused to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the\\ncase may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax\\nor such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate\\nprovided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.\\n\\n                                        12\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n13. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate amounts payable\\npursuant to Section 11 hereof by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor\\nshall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a) any\\nremuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or (b)\\nany claims the Company may have against the Executive.\\n\\n14.

Except as may be\\nrequired or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under\\nthis Agreement, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of\\nthe Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate\\nor divulge any such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company\\nand those designated by the Company.\\n\\n        (b) REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS. All records, files, drawings, documents,\\nmodels, and the like relating to the business of the Sunbeam Entities, which the\\nExecutive prepares, uses or comes into contact with and which contain\\nConfidential Information shall not be removed by the Executive from the premises\\nof any Sunbeam Entity (without the written consent of the Company) during or\\nafter the Employment Period unless such removal shall be required or appropriate\\nin connection with his carrying out his duties under this Agreement, and, if so\\nremoved by the Executive, shall be returned to such Sunbeam Entity immediately\\nupon termination of the Executive\\'s employment hereunder.\\n\\n        (c) NON-COMPETITION.

Following the Date of\\nTermination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent (5%) of\\nany publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof. If, at\\nany time, the provisions of this Section 14(c) shall be determined to be invalid\\nor unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area, duration\\nor scope of activity, this Section 14(c) shall be considered divisible and shall\\nbecome and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and scope of\\nactivity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or\\nother body having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive agrees that\\nthis Section 14(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any\\ninvalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. For purposes of\\nthis Section 14(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor barbecue\\ngrills and small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a Competitive\\nBusiness; provided, however, that the gross revenues derived from sales of such\\nproducts by such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10% of its total\\nrevenues and (ii) $500,000,000.\\n\\n        (d) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this\\nSection 14, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to apply for\\ninjunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to remedy any such\\nbreach or threatened breach, the Executive acknowledging that damages would be\\ninadequate and insufficient.\\n\\n        (e) CONTINUING OPERATION. Any termination of the Executive\\'s employment\\nor of this Agreement shall have no effect on the continuing operation of this\\nSection 14.\\n\\n15. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Executive to the full\\nextent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all expenses, costs,\\nliabilities and legal fees which the Executive may incur in the discharge of all\\nhis duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to be paid in\\nadvance by the Company for his expenses in defending a civil or criminal action,\\nproceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition thereof. The\\nExecutive shall be insured under the Company\\'s Directors\\' and Officers\\'\\nLiability Insurance Policy as in effect from time to time. Notwithstanding any\\nother provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any termination of the\\nExecutive\\'s employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the\\ncontinuing operation of this Section 15.\\n\\n                                       14\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n16.

GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive\\nreceives any payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or\\nbenefits pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a \"Payment\") that is subject\\nto the excise tax (the \"Excise Tax\") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue\\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), the Company shall pay to the Executive,\\nas soon thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a \"Gross-Up Payment\")\\nsuch that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any\\nExcise Tax imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax\\nand Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment.\\nThe determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or\\nbenefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment\\nshall be made by an independent auditor (the \"Auditor\") jointly selected by the\\nCompany and the Executive and paid by the Company. If the Executive and the\\nCompany cannot agree on the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and\\nthe Company shall each select one nationally recognized accounting firm and\\nthose two firms shall jointly select the nationally recognized accounting firm\\nto serve as the Auditor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of\\ndetermining the Gross-Up Payment in respect of any Payment, (i) any other\\npayments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection\\nwith a Change in Control or the Executive\\'s termination of employment (whether\\npursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or\\nagreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in\\nControl or any person affiliated with the Company or such person) shall be\\ntreated as \"parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 28OG(b)(2) of the\\nCode, and all \"excess parachute payments\" within the meaning of Section 28OG of\\nthe Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of\\ntax counsel selected by the Auditor, such other payments or benefits (in whole\\nor in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or are otherwise not subject\\nto the Excise Tax, and (ii) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income\\ntax at the highest marginal rate applicable in the calendar year in which the\\nGross-Up Payment is made, and state and local income taxes at the highest\\nmarginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive\\'s residence\\non the Date of Termination, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes\\nwhich could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the\\nevent the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount\\nused to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the\\ncase may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax\\nor such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate\\nprovided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.\\n\\n                 13. MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate\\namounts payable pursuant to Section 11 hereof by seeking other employment or\\notherwise, nor shall there be any offset against such payments on account of (a)\\nany remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that he may obtain or\\n(b) any claims the Company may have against the Executive.\\n\\n                 14.

Except as may be\\nrequired or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under\\nthis Agreement, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of\\nthe Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate\\nor divulge any such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company\\nand those designated by the Company.\\n\\n                          (b) REMOVAL OF DOCUMENTS. All records, files,\\ndrawings, documents, models, and the like relating to the business of the\\nSunbeam Entities, which the Executive prepares, uses or comes into contact with\\nand which contain Confidential Information shall not be removed by the Executive\\nfrom the premises of any Sunbeam Entity (without the written consent of the\\nCompany) during or after the Employment Period unless such removal shall be\\nrequired or appropriate in connection with his carrying out his duties under\\nthis Agreement, and, if so removed by the Executive, shall be returned to such\\nSunbeam Entity immediately upon termination of the Executive\\'s employment\\nhereunder.\\n\\n                          (c) NON-COMPETITION.

Following the\\nDate of Termination, ownership by the Executive of not more than five percent\\n(5%) of any publicly traded corporation shall not constitute a violation hereof.\\nIf, at any time, the provisions of this Section 14(c) shall be determined to be\\ninvalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area,\\nduration or scope of activity, this Section 14(c) shall be considered divisible\\nand shall become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and\\nscope of activity as\\n\\n                                       12\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nshall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body\\nhaving jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive agrees that this Section\\n14(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any invalid or\\nunenforceable provision had not been included herein. For purposes of this\\nSection 14(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor barbecue grills\\nand small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a Competitive Business;\\nprovided, however, that the gross revenues derived from sales of such products\\nby such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10% of its total revenues\\nand (ii) $500,000,000.\\n\\n                          (d) REMEDIES. In the event of a breach or threatened\\nbreach of this Section 14, the Executive agrees that the Company shall be\\nentitled to apply for injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction\\nto remedy any such breach or threatened breach, the Executive acknowledging that\\ndamages would be inadequate and insufficient.\\n\\n                          (e) CONTINUING OPERATION. Any termination of the\\nExecutive\\'s employment or of this Agreement shall have no effect on the\\ncontinuing operation of this Section 14.\\n\\n                 15. INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify the Executive\\nto the full extent permitted by law and the By-laws of the Company for all\\nexpenses, costs, liabilities and legal fees which the Executive may incur in the\\ndischarge of all his duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the right\\nto be paid in advance by the Company for his expenses in defending a civil or\\ncriminal action, proceeding or investigation prior to the final disposition\\nthereof.

THE PLAN, THE COMPANY. SUNBEAM CORPORATION (formerly known as Sunbeam-Oster\\nCompany, Inc.) (the \"Company\") established the Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. Execu\\ntive Benefit Retirement Plan effective as of December 15, 1994, and hereby\\nadopts the amendment and restatement of the plan, now known as SUNBEAM\\nCORPORATION EXEC UTIVE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PLAN (the \"Plan\"). The Plan as set\\nforth herein is effec tive December 15, 1994 (the \"Effective Date\"), except as\\notherwise specifically provided.\\n\\n1.2. EMPLOYERS. The Company and each other organization that is an employer\\nunder SUN BEAM CORPORATION 401(k) SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN (the \"401(k)\\nPlan\") shall be an \"Employer\" under this Plan unless specified to the contrary\\nby the Company by writing filed with the Committee described in subsection 1.4.\\n\\n1.3. PURPOSE. The Company and certain related businesses maintain and are\\nemployers under the 401(k) Plan, which is intended to meet the requirements of a\\n\"qualified plan\" under Sec tion 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose\\nof this Plan, a nonqualified plan, is generally to provide for eligible\\nemployees benefits that such employees do not earn under the 401(k) Plan because\\nsuch employees do not participate in the 401(k) Plan.\\n\\nThe Plan generally will allow Participants to elect to \"make\" before-tax\\ncontributions to the Plan in the same amount and same manner as under the terms\\nof the 401(k) Plan; the Employ ers will provide \"matching contributions\" based\\non a Participant\\'s before-tax contributions; lastly, the Employers will\\n\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nprovide \"profit sharing contributions\" allocated based on each Participant\\'s\\nCompensation for a year. This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for\\nthe purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management\\nor highly-compensated employees, as such plans are described in Sections 201(2),\\n301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\\n\"Contributions\" to the Plan are reflected through credits to bookkeeping\\naccounts that are adjusted periodically to reflect hypothetical investment\\nearnings. Participants are entitled to receive from the general assets of the\\nEmployers cash payments equal to the vested portion of their account balances,\\nas set forth in the Plan.\\n\\n1.4. PLAN ADMINISTRATION. The Plan is administered by the administrative\\ncommittee (the \"Committee\") that is responsible for administration of the 401(k)\\nPlan. To the extent appropriate, the Committee has the same powers, rights,\\nduties and obligations as are vested in the committee responsible for\\nadministration of the 401(k) Plan.\\n\\n1.5. COMPENSATION. For purposes of computing contributions and benefits under\\nthe Plan, an employee\\'s \"Compensation\" shall mean his compensation as defined\\nfrom time to time in Section 1.14 of the 401(k) Plan, determined, however,\\nwithout regard to any limits under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue\\nCode.\\n\\n                                    SECTION 2\\n\\n                          ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION\\n\\n2.1. COVERED EMPLOYEE. A \"Covered Employee\" means an employee of an Employer\\nunder the Plan who is selected by the Company\\'s board of directors or by a\\nperson or committee authorized to act on behalf of the board of directors. An\\nemployee who is selected shall con tinue as a Covered Employee until he\\nterminates employment with all Employers or until he is removed as a Covered\\nEmployee by the Company\\'s board of directors or by the\\n\\n                                      -2-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nperson or committee authorized to act on its behalf effective as of the end of a\\ncalendar year, whichever occurs first.\\n\\n2.2. ELIGIBILITY. Subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan, an\\nemployee of an Em ployer shall become eligible to enroll in this Plan and shall\\nbecome a \"Participant\" on the first date occurring on or after the Effective\\nDate on which he is a Covered Employee.\\n\\n2.3. PERIOD OF PARTICIPATION. An employee of an Employer who becomes a\\nParticipant in this Plan will continue as a Participant in the Plan in\\naccordance with its provisions until all bene fits to which he is entitled under\\nthe Plan have been distributed to him.\\n\\n                                    SECTION 3\\n\\n                                    BENEFITS\\n\\n3.1. INTENT. Commencing on the Effective Date, the provisions of this Section 3\\nare intended to allow a Participant to elect to make before-tax contributions,\\nto earn \"matching contribu tions\" that are at the same rate as those made by his\\nEmployer on behalf of 401(k) Plan Partic ipants, and to earn \"profit sharing\\ncontributions\" at the same rate as those made on behalf of participants under\\nthe 401(k) Plan.\\n\\n3.2. BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS.\\n\\n         (a)      For 1994, a Participant may elect to make Before-Tax\\n                  Contributions of any or all of his Compensation attributable\\n                  to services performed after the Effective Date (but not more\\n                  than $9,240). Beginning January 1, 1995, a Participant may\\n                  elect to make Before-Tax Contributions in whole multiples of\\n                  his Compensation from 1% to 10%, but not in excess of the\\n                  amount by which Before-Tax Contributions are limited in the\\n\\n                                      -3-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                  401(k) Plan because of Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue\\n                  Code. A Participant\\'s Before-Tax Contributions under this\\n                  subsection 3.2 shall be made pursuant to a compensation\\n                  deferral election by which the Participant elects to have his\\n                  Compensation reduced by the amount provided in the election,\\n                  and the Employer shall credit such amount to the Participant\\'s\\n                  account as provided in subsection 3.6.\\n\\n         (b)      An election shall be filed with the Participant\\'s Employer\\n                  prior to the calendar year such contributions are to begin,\\n                  or, for contributions to be made in 1994, within ten days of\\n                  the Effective Date. If a Participant first becomes eligible to\\n                  make such contributions after the Effective Date and during,\\n                  but after the beginning of, any subsequent calendar year, such\\n                  Participant\\'s deferral election must be filed with his Em\\n                  ployer not more than 30 days after so becoming eligible.\\n\\n         (c)      A Participant\\'s compensation deferral election under this\\n                  subsection 3.2 shall apply to Compensation otherwise payable\\n                  after the later to occur of the date the Participant becomes\\n                  eligible to make Before-Tax Contri butions and the date the\\n                  election is filed with his Employer. A Partici pant\\'s\\n                  compensation deferral election, however, may be revoked by the\\n                  Participant before the beginning of any subsequent calendar\\n                  year. The revocation shall be effective as to Compensation the\\n                  Participant is enti tled to receive during that and subsequent\\n                  calendar years unless prior to the commencement of any\\n                  subsequent calendar year the Participant makes another\\n                  compensation deferral election. Such later election shall\\n                  apply as to Compensation otherwise payable during calendar\\n                  years beginning after such later election is made.\\n\\n         (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant\\'s compensation\\n                  deferral election automatically\\n\\n\\n                                      -4-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                  shall be revoked for any period he ceases, in the sole opinion\\n                  of the Committee, to be a member of a select group of\\n                  management or a highly-compensated employee.\\n\\n3.3.  EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS.\\n\\n         (a)      For 1994, a Participant\\'s Employer shall make a matching\\n                  contribution equal to 50% of the Participant\\'s Before-Tax\\n                  Contributions for 1994; in addition the Participant\\'s Employer\\n                  shall make a matching contribution equal to the matching\\n                  contribution the Participant is precluded from receiving under\\n                  the 401(k) Plan because of the limits of Internal Reve nue\\n                  Code Section 401(m). In no event will the matching\\n                  contribution for 1994 exceed $4,620.\\n\\n         (b)      Beginning January 1, 1995, each calendar quarter a\\n                  Participant\\'s Em ployer shall make a matching contribution on\\n                  behalf of the Participant equal to 100% of the Participant\\'s\\n                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregard ing Before-Tax\\n                  Contributions in excess of 2% of a Participant\\'s Compensation)\\n                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions\\n                  (disregarding such contributions in excess of 4% of\\n                  Compensation) during the quarter, provided the Participant is\\n                  employed by an Em ployer on the last day of the quarter.\\n\\n         (c)      In addition, beginning with the 1995 calendar year, a\\n                  Participant\\'s Em ployer shall make an additional matching\\n                  contribution on behalf of the Participant as of the last day\\n                  of each calendar quarter so that the match ing contributions\\n                  for the Participant are equal to 100% of the Participant\\'s\\n                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregarding Before-Tax Con\\n                  tributions in excess of 2% of the Participant\\'s Compensation)\\n                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions\\n                  (disregarding such contribu tions in excess of 4% of\\n                  Compensation) during the year, provided the\\n\\n                                      -5-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                  Participant is employed by an Employer on the last day of the\\n                  quarter.\\n\\n         (d)      Such Employer contributions shall be called \"Employer Matching\\n                  Con tributions.\" The Employers shall make such contributions\\n                  by crediting Participants\\' accounts as provided in subsection\\n                  3.6. Beginning with the 1995 calendar year, the Employer\\n                  Matching Contribution for a Par ticipant for any year shall\\n                  not exceed 50% of the then current limit un der Section 402(g)\\n                  of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n\\n3.4. EMPLOYER PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS. Each calendar year, a Participant\\'s\\nEmployer shall make on behalf of the Participant an \"Employer Profit Sharing\\nContribution\" in an amount equal to a percentage of the Participant\\'s\\nCompensation for the year, such percentage to be the percentage of compensation\\nreceived as a profit sharing contribution for such year by eligible participants\\nin the 401(k) Plan; provided a Participant shall not receive a Profit Shar ing\\nContribution for a year unless he is employed by an Employer on the last day of\\nthe year or terminated employment with all Employers during the year because of\\ndeath, Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the 401(k) Plan).\\nThe Employer shall make the contributions by crediting the Participants\\'\\naccounts as provided in subsection 3.6.\\n\\n3.5. LIMITATION ON CONTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection\\n3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, in no event shall the contributions to the Plan made by or on\\non behalf of a Participant ex ceed for any year the lesser of (a) $30,000 (or\\nsuch greater amount as may be provided under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of the\\nInternal Revenue Code); or (b) 25% of taxable earnings from the Employers as\\nreflected on Form W-2 (which earnings shall be adjusted by addition of any\\ncompensation deferral contributions under this Plan and any deferrals or\\nreductions under Sections 401(k) and 125 of the Internal Revenue Code). The\\nlimitation of this subsection shall be applied to reduce (i) first, Employer\\nProfit Sharing Contributions otherwise made on behalf of the Participant, and\\n(ii) then, Participant Before-Tax Contri-\\n\\n                                      -6-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nbutions and any corre sponding Employer Matching Contributions made on behalf of\\nthe Participant. The Employ ers shall compensate the Participant for any\\nBefore-Tax Contributions that the Participant elected to make to the Plan but\\nthat cannot be made because of such limitations.\\n\\n3.6. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall maintain separate bookkeeping\\naccounts in the name of each Participant to reflect the Participant\\'s Before-Tax\\nContributions, and the Em ployer Matching and Profit Sharing Contributions made\\non his behalf. Contributions shall be credited (and payments shall be debited)\\nto accounts in such manner and at such time as the Committee shall determine on\\na uniform basis. A Participant\\'s accounts shall be deemed invested in\\nhypothetical investment funds (\"Funds\") in such proportions as the Participant\\nmay elect. The Funds shall be those in which 401(k) Plan participants may direct\\nthe invest ment of their accounts, unless the Committee shall determine\\notherwise. Each Participant shall elect the Funds in which his accounts are\\ndeemed to be invested pursuant to rules adopt ed by the Committee. If the\\nParticipant fails to select such Funds, the Participant shall be deemed to have\\nelected such Fund as the Committee shall determine. Each Participant\\'s ac counts\\nshall be adjusted as of such dates specified by the Committee to reflect\\ncontributions, payments and the investment gains and losses of the Funds. One of\\nthe Funds shall reflect investment in common stock of the Company (\"Company\\nStock\") subject to the following rules:\\n\\n         (a)      Employer Matching and Profit Sharing Contributions that are\\n                  credited to accounts on or after September 30, 1997 shall be\\n                  deemed invested in Company Stock, and Participants may not\\n                  elect otherwise.\\n\\n         (b)      A Participant may elect that any percentage (up to 100%) of\\n                  the other portion of his existing accounts be deemed invested\\n                  in Company Stock, and any such election may not be reversed. A\\n                  Participant may elect that all or any percentage of his future\\n                  compensation deferrals be deemed invested in Company Stock,\\n                  and any such percentage may not be reduced.\\n\\n                                      -7-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n         (c)      Any election to have any portion of his accounts deemed\\n                  invested in Company Stock shall be subject to such rules as\\n                  the Committee may determine for any reason, including\\n                  compliance with federal or state securities laws.\\n\\n3.7. TIME OF DISTRIBUTION; VESTING OF ACCOUNTS. Upon a Participant\\'s termination\\nof employ ment with all Employers on account of death, Disability or Retirement,\\nthe Participant (or in the event of his death, his Plan Beneficiary, as defined\\nin subsection 4.1) shall be entitled to receive the entire balance in all his\\naccounts in the manner provided in subsection 3.8.

A Participant who is removed as a Covered\\nEmployee (as provided in sub section 2.1) shall not be eligible to make\\nBefore-Tax Contributions or to have Employer Matching Contributions or Employer\\nProfit Sharing Contributions made on his behalf for any period he is not a\\nCovered Employee; such a Participant may continue to elect the investment of his\\naccounts among the Funds as provided in subsection 3.6 and may be eligible for\\npay ment of benefits in accordance with subsection 3.10 and 3.11, but shall not\\nbe eligible for a distribution of accounts under subsections 3.7 and 3.8 until\\nhe terminates employment with all Employers; such a Participant shall continue\\nto accrue Years of Service for vesting until he terminates employment with all\\nEmployers.\\n\\n                                      -8-\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n3.8.

The distribu tion period shall be five years, and the amount of each\\ninstallment shall be equal to the ac count balances as of the December 31\\npreceding the distribution divided by the number of remaining installments, with\\nthe last installment equal to the entire remaining account bal ances. Any such\\nelection to receive installments must be made and filed with the Committee at\\nleast twelve months before termination of employment. Upon the death of a\\nParticipant, any remaining amounts in his accounts shall be paid to his\\nBeneficiary as soon as practicable after the Participant\\'s death.\\n\\n3.9. CHANGE IN CONTROL.

Without the prior written consent of\\n                  the Company, except as required by law, such Participant will\\n                  not disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any\\n                  third party whatsoever or use the same in any manner except in\\n                  connection with the businesses of the Company and its\\n                  subsidiaries.

The Merger Consideration payable in connection with the\\nOffer shall automatically be adjusted appropriately for any stock dividend,\\nsplit or any conversion or reclassification in respect of the Company Common\\nStock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the date of consummation of\\nthe Offer, which shall occur only in accordance with the terms of this\\nAgreement. Buyer and MergerCo shall have the right to increase the Merger\\nConsideration in effect hereunder at any time, in which case the consideration\\npayable with respect to the Offer shall also be so increased.\\n\\n                  1.1.2 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE.

Offeror and the Company agree\\nto promptly correct any information provided by either of them for use in the\\nOffer Documents which shall have become false or misleading, and Offeror further\\nagrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-1 as so corrected\\nto be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be\\ndisseminated to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, in each case as\\nand to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

Before the 1996 special charges taken by the Company to\\nrestructure and reposition Sunbeam, earnings per share (diluted) from continuing\\noperations of $0.47 were $0.50 ahead of the loss of $0.03 reported in the fourth\\nquar ter last year. Including these charges earnings per share (diluted) rose\\n$2.76 above the reported $2.29 loss reported in 1996. On a year to date basis,\\nrevenue of $1.168 billion was 22.4% above 1996 on a comparable basis and\\nearnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations of $1.41 was $1.51 above\\nthe loss of $0.10 reported in 1996, excluding special charges. For the full year\\nof 1997, earnings per share (diluted) rose $3.78 from the loss of $2.37 reported\\nin 1996.\\n\\n1997 Highlights -- During 1997, the Company completed its restructuring program\\nand initiated a growth strategy that has generated consistent quarterly double\\ndigit sales growth throughout the year. The company exited all its non-core\\nbusinesses in 1997, closed 18 factories, 43 warehouses and 5 headquarters,\\nreduced employment by approximately 50% (half of which reflects reductions\\nrelated to the disposition of non-core businesses) and substantially reduced its\\nSKU offerings as part of its restructuring program. Concurrent with the\\nrestructuring program, the Company also implemented a three year growth plan to\\nstrengthen the Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brand names and expand distribution\\nglobally. Albert J. Dunlap, Sunbeam\\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said\\n\"I am very proud of the dramatic turnaround that we have achieved at Sunbeam in\\nsuch a short period of time as we continue to execute against our three year\\ngrowth plans. Our continu ous sales increases of 13%, 17%, 28% and 31% in the\\nfour quarters of 1997, for an overall sales increase of 22% for the year, are a\\nclear indication that our strategy is working.\"\\n\\nThe Company\\'s three year strategy to achieve $1 billion in revenue growth, which\\nit embarked upon in 1997, was fueled by the addition of 25 international\\ndistribution/license agreements, the introduction of 35 new U.S. products and 54\\nnew international products along with the contribu tion from 22 factory outlet\\nstores. \"We experienced sales growth in all major channels of distri bution, in\\nall regions of the world and in each of our five global businesses, and we\\ngained market share in all of our key product categories, reversing a three year\\ndownward trend, \" said Mr. Dunlap. Sales to the Company\\'s top 10 retailers were\\nup 15% and 22% in the latest quarter and\\n\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\nfull year, respectively. International sales which are projected to contribute\\n40% of the Company\\'s three year growth goal, were up 42%, and 34% for the\\nquarter and full year, respectively. Leading the sales growth internationally\\nwas the Asia/Pacific region, up 425%, and the Latin American region, up 32%.\\n\"The primary catalyst for this growth has been our ability to improve customer\\nservice levels and introduce innovative and differentiated new products at an\\naccelerated pace. As part of the restructuring we implemented a new product\\ndevelopment process that has enabled us to reduce new product development time\\nfrom over 2 years to approximately 6 months,\" said Mr. Dunlap.\\n\\n\"Equally as important as our strong top line growth was the remarkable\\nimprovement in operating margins, year over year, and the continuous margin\\nexpansion we delivered through-out the year. We set a three year goal to have\\n20% operating margins, and we were essentially at that level in the 3rd and 4th\\nquarters this year,\" said Mr. Dunlap. The Company\\'s operating margins of 20% in\\nthe 4th quarter and 17% for the full year reflect the numerous initiatives\\nassociated with the restructuring program. \"I am pleased with the pace of\\nimprovements in our financial performance and expect continued margin\\nenhancement in 1998,\" Mr. Dunlap said.\\n\\n1998 Goals -- The Company announced its goals for 1998, which anticipate\\nincreases in sales and margins at rates above those experienced in 1997. Mr.\\nDunlap, commenting on the Company\\'s 1998 revenue goals, said, \"We have\\nestablished sales growth goals that should exceed the impres sive results\\nreported in 1997. In 1998 we will continue our global expansion with the\\naddition of 30 new global products, a dozen more international\\ndistribution/license agreements and 10 more outlet stores. We expect to double\\nour media advertising spending to stimulate increased consumer pull for our\\nproducts and introduce new in-store merchandising programs to assist our retail\\npartners in the promotion and support of our aggressive growth goals.\" The\\nCompany expects to introduce new products in 1998 that will strengthen its\\nglobal product lines, and market positions, by focusing on technological\\ninnovation that satisfies chronic consumer needs.\\n\\nCommenting on the effect of the economic situation in Asia on the Company\\'s\\ninternational growth plans, Mr. Dunlap stated, \"Sunbeam has an advantage in that\\nwe started from a very low base. Unlike other companies which have exported\\nheavily to Asia for years, we still have an ex cellent opportunity to build our\\nbusiness rapidly in that region of the world. Our plans are to ini tially sell\\nour most highly differentiated products in Asia, like our electric blankets,\\nblenders, wa ter and air purifiers, hair clippers and ToastLogic(R) products.\\nMany of the products we will sell there can be sourced from Asian OEM\\nmanufacturers, providing flexibility to enhance our growth opportunities in the\\nAsia/Pacific region.\"\\n\\nMr. Dunlap said, \"I am confident that we have the right initiatives in place to\\nachieve our goals and further expand operating margins in 1998.\" The Company\\nplans to increase the amount of out-sourcing in 1998 to help support its sales\\ngrowth objectives for the Asia/Pacific region and to allow for added capacity\\nwithout adding bricks and mortar to its existing 8 factories. \"Currently our\\nmake/buy composition is around 70/30 and I have set a goal for the Company to\\nsource around 50% of its products and components by the end of 1998,\" said Mr.\\nDunlap.\\n\\n\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\nMr. Dunlap added, \"I have always believed that a merger or acquisition unleashes\\na quantum leap in creating shareholder value, and I am very eager to make this\\nstrategic move in the first half of 1998. We continue to work towards finalizing\\nour plans for merging with, or acquiring, one or more companies that will\\nprovide added value to all shareholders. We also remain open to a sale of the\\nCompany if that would produce greater value for our shareholders.\"\\n\\nSunbeam Corporation is a leading consumer products company that designs,\\nmanufactures and markets, nationally and internationally, a diverse portfolio of\\nbrand name products. The Com pany\\'s Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brands have been\\nhousehold names for generations, both domesti cally and abroad, and the Company\\nis a market leader in many of its product categories.\\n\\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Statements contained in this press release, including\\nstatements relating to the Company\\'s expectations regarding anticipated\\nperformance in the future, are all \"forward looking statements\" as such term is\\ndefined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE: SOC) initiated an\\naggressive expansion strategy today with the announcement of the acquisitions of\\nthree separate market leading durable consumer product companies. These\\ntransactions will enhance shareholder value by nearly tripling the Company\\'s\\nannual revenues, expanding its geographic presence, complementing its existing\\nproduct lines and leveraging operational synergies. The three transactions will\\ntotal approximately $2.5 billion and will be meaningfully accretive to Sunbeam\\'s\\nearnings within twelve months. The transactions are subject to regulatory\\napprovals and other customary conditions and are expected to close within the\\nnext two months.\\n\\nThe Coleman Company, Inc. (NYSE: CLN), with 1997 revenues of $1.1 billion is the\\nglobal leader in outdoor recreation and hardware products with powerful brands\\nsuch as Coleman/registered trademark/, Powermate/registered trademark/, Camping\\nGaz/registered trademark/ and Eastpak/registered trademark/. The Company, based\\nin Wichita, KS, operates 17 manufacturing facilities and employs approximately\\n6,000 people around the world. The transaction is valued at approximately $2.0\\nbillion, consisting of approximately $815 million in Sunbeam stock and the\\nbalance in debt financing. Shareholders of The Coleman Company, Inc. will\\nreceive $6.44 in cash and 0.5677 shares of Sunbeam stock for each share of\\nColeman stock.\\n\\nSignature Brands USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: SIGB), with 1997 revenues of $279 million,\\nis the North American leader in coffee makers marketed under the Mr.\\nCoffee/registered trademark/ brand name and is a leader in consumer health\\nproducts marketed under the Health o meter/registered trademark/ brand. The\\nCompany, based in Glenwillow, OH, operates two manufacturing facilities and\\nemploys approximately 1,000 people. The transaction is valued at approximately\\n$250 million consisting of a cash tender offer of $8.25 per SIGB share and the\\nassumption of existing debt.\\n\\nFirst Alert, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALRT) with 1997 revenues of $187 million, is the\\nworldwide leader in residential safety equipment, including smoke and carbon\\nmonoxide detectors. The Company, which is based in Aurora, IL, operates two\\nmanufacturing facilities and employs approximately 2,100 people. The transaction\\nis valued at approximately $175 million consisting of a cash tender offer of\\n$5.25 per ALRT share and the assumption of existing debt.\\n\\nAlbert J.

Our proven track\\nrecord coupled with our financial strength will enable us to successfully\\nexecute this strategy.\"\\n\\nThe Company anticipates initial synergies of approximately $150 million which\\nwill result in a substantial EPS accretion in 1999. A one time charge is\\nexpected in 1998 in order to restructure and consolidate these three companies\\ninto Sunbeam.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Company announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nAlbert J. Dunlap, along with Executive Vice Presidents Russell A. Kersh and\\nDavid C. Fannin have all renewed their commitment to the Company by signing new\\nthree year employment contracts. Mr. Kersh was named to the new position of vice\\nchairman of Sunbeam. Mr. Dunlap stated, \"I am eager to continue to create\\ntremendous value for our shareholders by building the leading durable consumer\\nproducts company in the world. This new employment agreement will put to rest\\nany rumors that I would leave the Company.\"\\n\\n\"This is a fantastic situation for all Sunbeam shareholders giving them the\\nopportunity to participate in the wealth that Al Dunlap and his team are\\nbuilding,\" said Ronald O. Perelman, who will become Sunbeam\\'s second largest\\nshareholder after the transaction. \"Coleman will thrive as part of Sunbeam\\'s\\nunbeatable family of brands,\" added Mr. Perelman.\\n\\nMichael Price, president and chief executive officer of Franklin Mutual Series\\nFund, Sunbeam\\'s largest shareholder, praised the transactions and new contracts.\\n\"With the simultaneous acquisitions of these three publicly traded companies,\\nSunbeam is launching into a bold new phase as the consolidator in its\\nindustries,\" Mr. Price said. \"Utilizing Al\\'s unique ability to restructure and\\nreposition companies, the opportunities for operating synergies and incremental\\nsales growth is substantial.
